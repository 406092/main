      <h3>What is the The Mitochondria?</h3>
      <p>
        The Mitochondria is an orgenelle found in both Plant and Animal cells.
        It is known as "The Power House of the Cell" due to the fact that it
        supplies the entire cell with energy using stored food that the organism
        creates or consumes. If it is a Plant Cell then the Mitochondria would
        use the Glucose created during photosynthesis. Whenever the Mitochondria
        is creating energy from these sugars it creates this energy known as
        "ATP." This energy is usually used as the currency around the cell.

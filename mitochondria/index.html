  <h3>What is the The Mitochondria?</h3>
  <p>
    The Mitochondria is an orgenelle found in both Plant and Animal cells. It is known as 
    "The Power House of the Cell" due to the fact that it supplies the entire cell with energy 
    using stored food that the organism creates or consumes. If it is a Plant Cell then the
    Mitochondria would use the Glucose created during photosynthesis. Whenever the Mitochondria
    is creating energy from these sugars it creates this energy known as "ATP." This energy is
    usually used as the currency around the cell.

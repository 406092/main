        If you are on this site and are Mrs.Jones, then hello Mrs.Jones! This website is my mini-project for school. I really
        don't know what else to make so I decided to do this. To start, first
        try to click on one of the cell images. From there, it should be self
        explanatory and easy to figure out.

    <h2>How do the 2 Connect?</h2>
    <p>
      Cellular respiration has a reactent of glucose which is 
      is sugars created during the photosynthesis process. Also, the
      plant cells need ATP because its like a fuel for them. Similiar
      to how we need food, plants get energy from sugars and cellular
      respiration durings those sugars into usuable energy which is called,
      you guessed it, ATP!
